#Collaberators:
[Ian Wilhite](linkedin.com/in/ian-wilhite)
- Electrical Systems
- Flight Controls
- Communication Protocols

[Victor Cardona](linkedin.com/in/victor-cardona-6b6856235/)
- Airfoil Design & Assembly
- 


Research:
- [inspo design](https://pterodynamics.com)
- [design spec ratios](https://www.radiocontrolinfo.com/rc-calculators/rc-airplane-design-calculator/)
- [motor calculator](https://rcplanes.online/calc_motor.htm)
- Thrust to weight ratio should be 1.3~1.5 (should round up)
- Weight probably 10 lbs (assume 15lbs)
- Lift coefieccient should be determined experimentally, should be 1~1.5 (should round down)

To Do:
1) motor shopping -> [hobbyking](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/power-systems/electric-motors.html#q=&idx=hbk_live_magento_en_us_products&dFR%5Bin_stock%5D%5B0%5D=1&dFR%5Bmotor_can_type%5D%5B0%5D=Outrunner&dFR%5Bmotor_features%5D%5B0%5D=Brushless%20-%20Sensorless&dFR%5Bwarehouses%5D%5B0%5D=USA&dFR%5Bwarehouses%5D%5B1%5D=Global&dFR%5Bwarehouses_stock_data%5D%5B0%5D=USA%7C3&dFR%5Bwarehouses_stock_data%5D%5B1%5D=Global%7C3&hFR%5Bcategories.level0%5D%5B0%5D=Power%20Systems%20%2F%2F%2F%20Electric%20Motors&nR%5Bhbk_price.stock_2_group_2%5D%5B<%3D%5D%5B0%5D=51&is_v=1)
2) the rest of the hardware: 
    - power dist board
    - flight controller
    - esc w: 4 independent motors & 2 linked servos
3) fuselage & airfoils
4) hinge mechanism/ slider
